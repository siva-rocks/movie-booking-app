movie booking app

Movie seat booking app, consists of three components (movies, seats-booking, e-ticket).  Movies component fetches the movies from available options. When a movie is clicked the id of that movie is passed to the seats-booking component. The user choose the desired seats and when seat is selected or deselected, the total amount also changes simultaneously. On clicking the checkout button the e-ticket component is mounted which show the ticket with all information and also generates the pdf using html2pdf 

While working on this project, I learned about hooks, transitions, reactive values, local storage,etc.
